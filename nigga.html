    Immortal temptation
    Takes over my mind, condemned
    Falling weak on my knees
    Summon the strength of mayhem
    I am the storm that is approaching
    Provoking black clouds in isolation
    I am reclaimer of my name
    Born in flames, I have been blessed
    My family crest is a demon of death
    Forsakened, I am awakened
    A phoenix's ash in dark divine
    Descending misery
    Destiny chasing time
    Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
    Can't run away
    Keep walking the line, between the light
    Led astray
    Through vacant halls I won't surrender
    The truth revealed in eyes of ember
    We fight through fire and ice forever
    Two souls once lost, and now they remember
    I am the storm that is approaching
    Provoking black clouds in isolation
    I am reclaimer of my name
    Born in flames, I have been blessed
    My family crest is a demon of death
    Forsakened, I am awakened
    A phoenix's ash in dark divine
    Descending misery
    Destiny chasing time
    Disappear into the night
    Lost shadows left behind
    Obsession's pulling me
    Fading, I've come to take what's mine
    Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
    Constellations of blood pirouette
    Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
    Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
    A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes
    The puppet master congregates all the masses
    Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
    You want this power? Then come try and take it
    Beyond the tree, fire burns
    Secret love, bloodline yearns
    Dark minds embrace, crimson joy
    Does your dim heart heal or destroy?
    Bury the light deep within
    Cast aside, there's no coming home
    We're burning chaos in the wind
    Drifting in the ocean all alone
